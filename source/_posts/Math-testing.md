# Math relationship

When we have $\sqrt{x+c}$ where $c$ is a constent, can we write it as $\sqrt{x}+c$ ?

Similarly, can we write $\frac{a + c}{b}$ where $c$ is constent as $\frac{a}{b} + c$? we cannot since

$$
\frac{a+c}{b}=\frac{a}{b}+\frac{c}{b}
$$

And this $\frac{c}{b}$ is not independent from variable
