I implemented this algorithm for filling gaps in a time series data. The full Repository is here: [Repo](https://github.com/LiSiruiRay/Filling-gaps-in-chaotic-time-series), where you can check the paper my Professor Paparella published, based on which this algorithm is implemented.

Here is a good-looking demo.
