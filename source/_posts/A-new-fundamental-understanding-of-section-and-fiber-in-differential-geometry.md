I started learning abstract algebra during the summer. For my future interests (logic and automated thoerem proving), I chose a textbook that introduce abstract algebra from a category perspective: _[Algebra: Chapter 0.](https://www.math.fsu.edu/~aluffi/mainhtmls/pubs.html#Chapter0)_ by Professor [Paolo Aluffi](https://www.math.fsu.edu/~aluffi/).

During reading this book. I saw the following:

Yet in differential geometry, where I first met the concept of sections and fibers, the definition are introduced in the following way:

Let $(T, B, \pi)$ be a vector bundle, where $T$ is called total space, $B$ (A manifold) is called base space. We have $B \times T$ is locally isomorphic to open subset $U \times R^n$.

Thus a vector field $X \in \mathfrak{X}(M)$ can be seen as something that make the function a bijection--the fiber contains one element.
