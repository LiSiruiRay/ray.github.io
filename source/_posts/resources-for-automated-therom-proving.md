Next semester I will be taking _CSCI-UA 480 Special Topics: Principles of Programming Languages_ by Professor [Thomas Wies](https://cs.nyu.edu/~wies/).

This course will be important for me to take further steps in automated thereom proving.

Here are some resources Prof Wies introduced.

- A series of books for introduction of functional programming: [Software Foundation Series](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/)
- Book written by Prof Wies' Team [Automated Verification of Concurrent Search Structures](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-01806-0)

Here are some more video-type resource I found:

- [Introduction to Functional Programming in OCaml](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/en/courses/introduction-functional-programming-ocaml/) (This course is archieved, but their video is on YouTube). [YouTube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9-K0X2710Y&list=PLGC2in6hSHQcmT_cz4t7ePeQtTCkNkvll&index=4&ab_channel=Roshan%2a)
  - I also found the [GitHub Repo of the hw](https://github.com/bugczw/Introduction-to-Functional-Programming-in-OCaml), [Textbook and Project](https://github.com/uds-psl/Prog), and [Solution to the hw](https://github.com/philsaxton/OCamlMOOC).
