I am taking the MATH-GA.2430-001 Real Variables I, by Tristan Buckmaster, 2024 Fall. 

The textbook we used is "Real Analysis Measure Theory, Integration and Hilbert Spaces (Elias M. Stein, Rami Shakarchi)".

Here are some good complementary materials:

- MIT's functional analysis: [Functional Analysis](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-102-introduction-to-functional-analysis-spring-2021/pages/syllabus/)
- I also added some comments on the notes, based on MIT's course, which is also open sourced: [My notes](https://github.com/LiSiruiRay/functional_analysis/blob/main/main.pdf)

# Detailed resources
- If you can understand Chinese, here is a good video introducing measure according to stein: [Measure Theory](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Nc41157FB/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=d84085799dfdb99d199a04d156250394)
- While learning "Littlewoodâ€™s three principles" (Page 33 of Stein), I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KPgRzsnG5k&ab_channel=Problemathic)
