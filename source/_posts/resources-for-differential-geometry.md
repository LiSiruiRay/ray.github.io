# Textbook

## TextBook I used for [Differential Geometry](https://bulletins.nyu.edu/courses/math_uh/) class at New York University, Abu Dhabi

# Passages I read

## Tensor

### In Chinese

- "看完本文, 彻底理解张量" 系列： [看完本文, 彻底理解张量(上)](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/508715535), [看完本文, 彻底理解张量(下)](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/508715717), and [矢量算符是啥? 复内积怎么升降指标? 「彻底理解张量」拓展篇](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/565588180). I only read the first one (several time), cuz this is enough for my course. This is a really good series.

## Manifold

### In Chinese

- [几何学中最伟大的发明之一——流形，其背后的几何直觉与数学方法](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/622263134)

## Vector Bundle (In English)

- [Vector Bundles & K-Theory](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/VBKT/VBpage.html) pdf can be found in the link. Very good book on introducing vector bundle.

# Videos

# In Chinese

- [北京某高校《李群和李代数》](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1JH4y177KC/?spm_id_from=333.788&vd_source=d84085799dfdb99d199a04d156250394). Still updating. This is a graduate level couse, I only watched the first three videos. But those are enough for providing a more abstract, deeper, and more concise understanding of what I am learning now.
- [最美数学系列 — 什么是微分流形](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1PK4y1Q7BU/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=d84085799dfdb99d199a04d156250394). Very intuitive introduction to manifold, tangent space, etc. The tangent space part is really helpful for me.
- [Ayumu 谈谈商空间、商映射、商拓扑](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1o341197jS/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=d84085799dfdb99d199a04d156250394). Very clean, detailed, easy-to-understand approach for understand Quotient space, my blog [Introduction to Quotient Spaces in Topology](https://blog.slray.com/2024/04/09/Introduction-to-Quotient-Spaces-in-Topology/) is translated from this video.

# In English, YouTube

- [Tensors For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ptMTLzV4-I&list=PLJHszsWbB6hrkmmq57lX8BV-o-YIOFsiG&ab_channel=eigenchris). The Best video introducing tensors I've seen so far. I watched this several times on airplane. Really helpful.
- [Manifolds Explained in 5 Levels of Difficulty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABQ0w08nTBQ&t=14s&ab_channel=FermionPhysics). A general introduction to manifold.
- [What is a manifold?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIjBArHTPZ4&ab_channel=GeometryForPhysicists). A general introduction to manifold. Very intuitive introduction.
- [What is a Manifold?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEXSSz0gZI4&list=PLRlVmXqzHjUQHEx63ZFxV-0Ortgf-rpJo&ab_channel=XylyXylyX). Longer, more regious introduction.
- [Real Projective Space, n = 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ottRuDA5WA&t=5s&ab_channel=MathForLife) and [Real Projective Space, n=2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDtwgpQfJlc&t=474s&ab_channel=MathForLife). Really intuitive and clear introduction to projective space.
- [Vector Bundles and Char Classes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVFWrMCfje8&list=PLCgncMh0TrCmrkvT7zW0x32flMJLuYMT5&ab_channel=HarpreetBedi). Very good series, the book [Vector Bundles & K-Theory](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/VBKT/VBpage.html) is recommanded here.
- [Manifolds](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBh2i93oe2qvRGAtgkTszX7szZDVd6jh1). Video from _The Bright Side of Mathematics_, very good YouTuber on Math. This video series introduces manifold from topological perspective, while I learned from calculus and linear algebra perspective.
