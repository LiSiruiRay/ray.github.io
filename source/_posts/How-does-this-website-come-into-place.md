excerpt: This is a blog about how I build this website from zero, which is f* hard.

I wrote this blog for those of you who might be interested in building a website, not necessaryly a personal blog. You could simply show your projects, resume, or just have a world of your own. I build this blog out of nothing but a thought, thus do not let coding or CS skills become an obstacle on your way.

There will be a table of content on the right side, feel free to jump to the prefered part.

# Why would I care about how you build this website?
A short answer would be very similar to the introduction. Yet other than that, you can truly learn a lot from exploring the world of web. I tried AWS, Google Could, Microsoft cloud, and even a local server--a Rasperry Pi; I bought a domain name, trying to connect it to my cloud server, which spent tens of my life and hair. During the process, I got a touch on what dynamic/static web page is, what DNS is, what IP address is, to name a few. It is a journey worth to try. 

# So how did you build this website?
A short answer: [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) + [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) + a domain name([slray.com](https://slray.com/)).

## Why GitHub Pages
I am an international student from China, and I would love to show my website to both my friends from China and the rest of the world. Fortunately, [GitHub](https://github.com/) is no longer blocked in China. Thus, I used [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as my web server.

### A problem with GitHub Pages
You can only deploy static web pages. This does not mean that you cannot have animations or special effects for the website. A static web pages is more like a solely online web page, meaning that you can not(or it is very hard to) collect data from the websites as well as show data. In other words, you can have a blog showing your words, your pictures, or your videos. Yet you cannot deploy a web application. 

However, that would not be a huge problem, and a static page is already enough for now.

## What is Hexo
This is a website providing well-designed web-pages for those who are bad at designing. I used this website for a better appearance of the design of the website.

Remember when doing a slide for presentation, groupmates would go online for templates. [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) is a similar website for template, but for webpages instead of a slide. (Come on, a website is much coooler than a slide!)

I have spent so much time on this website. This would be my first official post with content. It would not be an easy job to build a website, espcially when you are fighting alone and searching up the questions that only have two pages of result. I know there would still be a lot of confusions: what is a web server? what is git? what is a domain? what is web? what is those `http` stuff. Is it expensive to build a website? I will probably post more details about how I build this website. I basically tried out most of the ways and touched on most of erros. I would love to try my best to save some time and provide some consolation for those who are encoutering the same problems and feeling that no one could help. 

See you next time!
